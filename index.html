			Hello! I am CaptAwesome. I am a game developer and an aspiring YouTuber.
			What I want to do is entertain people, and make them happy.
			I consider my work a success if it makes at least one person smile, if only for a little while.
			I hope you enjoy the games and videos I make.
		</p>

			What I do, I can't do alone.
			That is why I have a wonderful team of amazing people helping me with every step of the way.
			You can meet my team <a href="./pages/team.html">here</a>.
